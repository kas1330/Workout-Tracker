## Testing

The easiest way to test the function of the application would be to click on the link to the deployed app on Heroku. You should be able to add a new workout or continue and existing one. You should also see the dashboard option in the top lefthand corner, this will show you some stats and charts. The more difficult way to test would be to git clone the repository, npm install everything, set up your connection in the server.js file, run the seed file using "node seeders/seed.js", and start the server using npm start. Go to your browser and type in "localhost:3000", this will launch the app, and you should be able to follow the same steps as the deployed version to test the app.
